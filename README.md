# PwnOffsetPatcherApp

PwnOffsetPatcherApp (PwnAppleHat) is a cross-platform desktop application that allows users to apply a variety of hacks to `.ipa` files for popular mobile games like PUBG MOBILE and Call of Duty®: Mobile. This tool automates the process of modifying the game binary with user-selected hacks, making it easier for players to customize their experience.

## Features

- **Supports Multiple Games & Versions**: Works with various versions of PUBG MOBILE (Global, VN, TW, KR, IN) and Call of Duty®: Mobile (VNG, KR).
- **Game Hacks**: Offers a variety of hacks, including Aimbot, No Recoil, Auto Aim, No Grass, Speed Hacks, and more.
- **Automated iPA Handling**: Downloads and modifies `.ipa` files automatically, or users can manually select the file.
- **Cross-Platform**: Available for both Windows and macOS, compiled using PyInstaller.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Built with `Tkinter`, the app offers an easy-to-navigate interface to select games, versions, and hacks.

## How It Works

1. **Game Selection**: Users select the game they wish to modify.
2. **Version Selection**: Choose the version of the game you want (e.g., PUBG MOBILE Global 3.4, CODM VNG 1.8.47).
3. **Hack Selection**: Select the hacks you want to apply from a list of available options.
4. **Download or Manual File Selection**: The app will either download the game’s `.ipa` file or allow users to manually select a pre-downloaded `.ipa` or binary file.
5. **Modification**: Once the `.ipa` is downloaded or selected, the app applies the hacks to the game binary.
6. **iPA Packaging**: The modified `.ipa` is repackaged and saved to your desktop, ready for installation.
